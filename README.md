# Baubulous

A game demo created for Christmas 2016, inspired by 8-bit game [Nebulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulus_(video_game)).

Baubulous is built in Xamarin + MonoGame. Sadly it won't compile in 2021.

## Playing

If you'd like to try it, the apk is available for download from this repository.

You ought to be able to download and open it on an Android device. (You'll see a number of warnings from Google Play Protect about how old the apk is.)
